If you use the built-in options and it's broken because of a lib you didn't even know existed or will never use, please choose your own libs and avoid creating issues about it. I barely have any time or will to maintain this.

For new libs and tools pull requests are strongly recommended instead of opening a feature request for the same reason above.

Make sure to mention if you are building for 32-bit or 64-bit or both and mention what the suite failed to build. Please make sure to at least give the title a little detail as to what you failed to compile.

Any issues without a `logs.zip` or at least an error report with either be ignored or closed without warning. Any issue not dealing with the suite or a custom build will not be supported and should be taken to the proper forums or repo page.

If you understood the above, add the info below:
--->

``` bash
Paste output of the suite here
```
