If you use the built-in options and it's broken because of a lib you didn't even
know existed or will never use, please choose your own libs and avoid creating
issues about it. I barely have any time or will to maintain this.

For new libs and tools pull requests are strongly recommended instead of opening
a feature request for the same reason above.
